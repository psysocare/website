Psysocare Website Setup Guide
================================

You have all the necessary files for your website. Here are your critical next steps to make it fully live and functional.

--------------------
Step 1: Save Your Files
--------------------
1. Create a new folder on your computer named `psysocare-website`.
2. Inside this folder, create three files:
   - `index.html` (Copy the content for File 1 here)
   - `privacy.html` (Copy the content for File 2 here)
   - `README.txt` (Copy the content for File 3 here)

--------------------
Step 2: Activate Your Contact Form
--------------------
Your contact form will not work until you do this.

1. Go to https://formspree.io/ and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a "New Form". Name it "Psysocare Contact Form".
3. Formspree will give you a unique URL that looks like `https://formspree.io/f/xxxxxxxx`.
4. Open your `index.html` file.
5. Find the line that says `<form action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_UNIQUE_ID" method="POST">`.
6. **Replace** `https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_UNIQUE_ID` with the actual URL you got from Formspree.
7. Save the `index.html` file. Now when someone submits the form, you will receive an email.

--------------------
Step 3: Set Up Website Analytics (Optional, but Recommended)
--------------------
1. Go to https://analytics.google.com/ and sign up with your Google account.
2. Create a "New Property" for your website.
3. Follow the steps to create a "Data Stream" for your website.
4. Google will provide you with a JavaScript tracking code snippet.
5. Open your `index.html` file.
6. Find the comment that says ``.
7. **Paste** the entire script provided by Google right below that comment.
8. Save the file. After 24-48 hours, you will start seeing visitor data in your Google Analytics dashboard.

--------------------
Step 4: Deploy Your Website
--------------------
To make your website live on the internet, you need to host it.

1. **Choose a Host:** For this type of website, **Netlify** (https://www.netlify.com/) is highly recommended. It's free and very fast.
2. **Sign Up:** Create a free account on Netlify.
3. **Deploy:** Find the "Sites" section in your Netlify dashboard. There will be an area where you can **drag and drop** your `psysocare-website` folder.
4. **Your Site is Live:** Netlify will instantly upload your files and give you a random web address (like `random-name-12345.netlify.app`). You can use this link to view your live site.
5. **Add Custom Domain:** If you have purchased a domain name (e.g., `psysocare.com`), you can go into the site settings on Netlify and follow the instructions to link your domain.

--------------------
Step 5: How to Create the ZIP File
--------------------
Once you have saved all the files in the `psysocare-website` folder:
1. Right-click on the `psysocare-website` folder.
2. On Windows, choose "Send to" > "Compressed (zipped) folder".
3. On a Mac, choose "Compress 'psysocare-website'".
This will create a `psysocare-website.zip` file, which contains your entire project.
